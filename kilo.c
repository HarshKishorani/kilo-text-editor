/*
    The 'CTRL_KEY' macro bitwise-ANDs a character with the value 00011111, in binary.
    (In C, you generally specify bitmasks using hexadecimal, since C doesn’t have binary literals, and hexadecimal is more concise and
    readable once you get used to it.)

    In other words, it sets the upper 3 bits of the character to 0.
    This mirrors what the Ctrl key does in the terminal: it strips bits 5 and 6 from whatever key you press in combination with Ctrl,
    and sends that.
    (By convention, bit numbering starts from 0.) The ASCII character set seems to be designed this way on purpose.
    (It is also similarly designed so that you can set and clear bit 5 to switch between lowercase and uppercase.)

        Turn off flags:
        - Local Flag : "ECHO" command
        - Local Flag : "ICANON" (Canonical mode for the terminal)
        - Local Flag : "ISIG" (Turn off 'Ctrl-C' => sends a SIGINT signal to the current process which causes it to terminate,
                       and 'Ctrl-Z' => sends a SIGTSTP signal to the current process which causes it to suspend.)
                       Now Ctrl-C can be read as a 3 byte and Ctrl-Z can be read as a 26 byte.
        - Input flag : "IXON" (Turn off => "Ctrl-S" and "Ctrl-Q" are used for software flow control. Ctrl-S stops data from being transmitted to the terminal until you press "Ctrl-Q".)
                       Now Ctrl-S can be read as a 19 byte and Ctrl-Q can be read as a 17 byte.
        - Local flag : "IEXTEN" (Disable "Ctrl-V", the terminal waits for you to type another character and then sends that character literally.)
                       Ctrl-V can now be read as a 22 byte, and Ctrl-O as a 15 byte.
        - Input flag : "ICRNL" (Diable Ctrl-M)
                       Now Ctrl-M is read as a 13 (carriage return), and the Enter key is also read as a 13.
        - Output flag : We will turn off all output processing features by turning off the "OPOST" flag.

        Miscellaneous flags
        - When "BRKINT" is turned on, a break condition will cause a SIGINT signal to be sent to the program, like pressing Ctrl-C.
        - "INPCK" enables parity checking, which doesn’t seem to apply to modern terminal emulators.
        - "ISTRIP" causes the 8th bit of each input byte to be stripped, meaning it will set it to 0. This is probably already turned off.

        - "CS8" is not a flag, it is a bit mask with multiple bits, which we set using the bitwise-OR (|) operator unlike all the flags we are turning off.
          It sets the character size (CS) to 8 bits per byte. On my system, it’s already set that way.

        Escape sequences always start with an escape character (27) followed by a [ character.
        Escape sequences instruct the terminal to do various text formatting tasks, such as coloring text, moving the cursor around, and clearing parts of the screen.

        We are using the J command (Erase In Display) to clear the screen.

        Escape sequence commands take arguments, which come before the command.
        In this case the argument is 2, which says to clear the entire screen.
        <esc>[1J would clear the screen up to where the cursor is, and <esc>[0J would clear the screen from the cursor up to the end of the screen.
        Also, 0 is the default argument for J, so just <esc>[J by itself would also clear the screen from the cursor to the end.
